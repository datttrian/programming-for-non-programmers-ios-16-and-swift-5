This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Programming for Non-Programmers: iOS 16 and Swift 5
. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

Do you want to develop native iOS applications, but aren’t sure where to start? This course gives you a chance to try it out with a simple iOS application that you can create in a single day. Instructor Todd Perkins uses visual representations of conceptual aspects of coding to make the content relatable and digestible. Todd shows you how to set up your coding environment, work with variables to build a user interface, use conditional statements to manage control flow, and much more. Plus, he goes over best practices for finishing your application, including how to format numbers and add an app icon. At the end of the course, you’ll have the skills needed to create an iOS app on your own.
